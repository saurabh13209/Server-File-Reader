<h1>Server File Reader</h1>
<h2>An app which helps you to share files across your devices without any wires.</h2>
With SFR, User can interact with their PC remotely using their smartphone. I have tried to deploy this on Linux (Debian/Ubuntu) as well as on Windows systems.
<h4>Prime features of this app are</h4>
<ul>
<li>See the contents of the directories existing on your PC and navigate through them.</li>
<li>Stream video and audio files directly from your computer without having to download them. Saving a lot of storage space of your mobile</li>
<li>Get all notifications directly on your PC as they pop up on your mobile.</li>
<li>Two way sharing of files between your PC and mobile phone.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Bash:</b> For setting up this application on Linux. The script automatically installs all the required packages for SFR to run smoothly.</li>
<li><b>PHP:</b> Used to develop APIs which help to fetch list of directories and to upload and download files.</li>
<li><b>Android:</b> Used to develop native application.</li>
</ul>
